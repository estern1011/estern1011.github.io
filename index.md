## About
Hi! I'm Eric Stern, a 4th year (out of 5) computer science and business administration major at Northeastern University.

### Professional
I've completed two co-ops so far:
- I was a mobile engineering co-op at [Rue Gilt Groupe](https://www.ruegiltgroupe.com/) from July 2018 to December 2018. I worked on their Android team there maintaining and updating the Rue La La and Gilt apps. 
- I was a backend software engineering co-op at [Exabeam](http://exabeam.com/) from July 2019 to December 2019. I worked on the Incident Responder team where I worked on their backend Scala API and created a configurable Python tool to create time series metrics dashboards using InfluxDB and Chronograf.
    - I also came up with my software engineer table tennis theory: if a software engineer is a table tennis player, their seniority can be measured by how nasty their serve is.

In addition to co-ops, I also tutored for [Fundamentals of Computer Science II](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510/) from September 2017 to April 2018 (two semesters) where I held office hours, helped students complete labs, and graded homework assignments.

### Personal
- I've completed a few personal projects, which can be found [here](/projects).
- I'm often either watching Mets games, or waiting for baseball season to start (being a NY Giants fan has been painful the past few years). 
- I'm a mentor in the [Computer Science Mentoring Organization](https://nucosmo.club/) at Northeastern
- I play for the NEU Counter-Strike: Global Offensive C team.
- I really suck at squash (and table tennis, see my theory above).
